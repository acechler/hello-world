## About me

### Introduction
Hello my name is Aaron, I am an aspiring software engineer. The first programming language that I was taught is C++, I eventually learned some C# to help me understand C Style syntax and how to program. I am currently a lab contractor so I run tests and work with science equipment. I currently go to Sinclair Community College, I am pursuing a degree in Software Engineering. I hope one day to transfer my credits to a university.

### Hobbies

Besides coding I enjoy learning my musical instrument which is the guitar. My interest in music and programming merged into an interest in using Digital Audio Workstations or DAW. I use FL Studio to mix music and record music and being able to do this does take problem solving skills and patience.

### Goals

I want to become a software engineer but I also want to create video games on the side. I have an interest in 2D pixel art and roguelike video games. I have worked with the following engines below.

- Gamemaker
- Unreal Engine
- Godot
- Unity

I have not managed to create anything notable just yet, I hope to do so one day.
